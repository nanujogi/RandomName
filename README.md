# RandomName

Ben Scheirman, on twitter announced that he will sponsor one Hacking with Swift Plus account.
There were several participants, some 115 while i made this small program.

The program will randomly select names every 0.1 seconds & will do that for 115 times. Fair chance to all participants.

It uses SwiftUI, Combine to find an random name & keep adding in array & also counts number of times an random name got selected.
The program first lists all participants.
We need to tap Search Winner button to generate random names.
Finally tap Winner button to get the winner name.

It's an fun project. Nothing special.

Cheers Nanu Jogi
